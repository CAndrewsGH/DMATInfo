How many shirts did Heather iron?  Raymond's job pays $22 per hour for the first forty hours and $33 per hour for each hour in the week worked above the 40 hours. If he earned $1,210 this week, how many overtime hours did he work?  Susan charges $120 plus $40 an hour to clean houses. If a client's total bill were $280, how many hours did Susan spend cleaning the client's house?  A consultant charges $100 plus $50 an hour. How many hours did the consultant work if the total bill were $850?  Holly bought a sweater on sale for 40% off the original price. If she saved $24, what was the original price?  Ming got a 3% raise in her salary from last year. This year she is earning $30,900. How much did she make last year?  A brother and sister split the $1,166,000 from the sale of their parent's house. According to the will, the sister was to receive 20% more than her brother, for having managed the property. How much money did the sister receive?  Kevin invested part of his $10,000 bonus in a certificate of deposit that paid 6% annual simple interest, and the remainder in a mutual fund that paid 11% annual simple interest. If his total interest for that year was $700, how much did Kevin invest in the mutual fund?  A bank loaned out $50,000, part of it at the rate of 11% per year and the rest at a rate of 7% per year. If the interest received was $4,740, how much was loaned at 11%?  Sue took her collection of nickels and dimes to deposit in the bank. She has five fewer nickels than dimes. Her total deposit was $73.40. How many dimes did she deposit?  A theatrical production company donated free tickets for their show to the local Boys \\amp Girls Club. They claimed that the ticket value was $225 A child's ticket cost $4.25 and an adult ticket cost $6.50. If there were twice as many children's tickets as adult tickets, how many adults and children got to attend the show for free?   "
